# 🎮 Othello (Reversi) — Java (OOP, Terminal Based)

A fully interactive **Othello (Reversi)** game built in **Java**, running directly in the **terminal/console**. This project demonstrates strong usage of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, strategic logic implementation, and clean code structure.

## 🚀 Features

* **Terminal-based gameplay**
* **Two-player mode**
* **Automatic flipping of opponent pieces**
* **Valid move detection**
* **Game-over detection (no moves left / board full)**
* **Score calculation at the end**
* **Clean and intuitive console UI**

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used

* **Classes & Objects** for board, players, and game controller
* **Encapsulation** to protect game data
* **Modularity** to keep logic separated and organized
* **Reusability** through well-structured methods
* **Clean architecture** for easy updates or future GUI integration
